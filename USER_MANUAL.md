## 4. Shift System — How It Works

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Understanding how shifts work in this system is critical. **Shifts are continuous** — there is no manual "Open Shift" button on the POS terminal. The system automatically tracks time periods between Z-Read closings.

### How the Continuous Shift Model Works

The system does **not** require you to manually start a shift. Instead:

- **Starting cash** is determined automatically: it equals the **actual cash count entered at the last shift close**.
- If there has never been a shift closed before, starting cash defaults to **₱0.00**.
- Sales are tracked from the **end of the last shift** to the **current moment**.
- The shift "period" covers all time since the previous Z-Read (close).

This means:
- You can start selling **immediately** after logging in.
- The system is always "in shift" — tracking all sales continuously.
- The only action you perform is **closing the shift** (Z-Read) at the end of the day or your work period.

### Live Shift Summary (Settings Page)

Cashiers can view the current shift's running totals at any time by going to **Settings → Shift Summary**:

- **Starting Cash** — the actual cash count from the last close (or ₱0 if first time)
- **Cash Sales** — total cash sales since last close
- **Expected in Drawer** — Starting Cash + Cash Sales
- **Digital Sales Breakdown** — GCash, Maya, Credit, Debit (if any)
- **Total Gross Sales** — all payment methods combined

---

## 5. Using the POS Terminal

The POS Terminal is split into two panels side by side (on desktop and tablet):

| Left Panel | Right Panel |
|---|---|
| **Current Order (Cart)** | **Product Catalog** |

On mobile, these alternate — tap **"View Order"** at the bottom to switch to the cart.

### Product Catalog (Right Panel)

#### Toolbar Controls

| Control | Function |
|---|---|
| **Category button** | Opens a category filter dropdown |
| **Search bar** | Search products by name or SKU/barcode |
| **Wholesale Mode toggle** | Switch all prices to wholesale pricing |
| **Results Only toggle** | Hide catalog until a search is typed (scan-mode) |
| **+ Custom Item button** | Add a new product on the fly |

#### Searching for Products

- **By name** — Type any part of the product name
- **By SKU/Barcode** — Type or scan the barcode. When a single match is found or a SKU is exact-matched, the system auto-selects and opens the quantity modal
- **USB Barcode Scanner** — Plug in a USB scanner. Scanning auto-triggers the quantity entry modal with a beep
- **Camera Scanner** — Available in Inventory for scanning barcodes via the device camera

#### Filtering by Category

1. Click the **Category** button (left of the search bar) — or press **F5**.
2. A dropdown appears with colored category badges.
3. Select a category. The catalog filters immediately.
4. Select **All Categories** to clear.
5. Press **Escape** or click outside to close the dropdown.

#### Product List Columns (Desktop)

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **SKU / Barcode** | Unique product code (click to copy) |
| **Product Name / Category** | Name + colored category badge |
| **Stock** | Remaining available stock |
| **Price** | Retail or wholesale price (depends on mode) |

#### Stock Color Indicators

| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | Normal stock level |
| 🟠 Orange | Low stock (fewer than 10 units) |
| 🔴 "Sold Out" | Zero stock — item cannot be added to cart |

> [!NOTE]
> Stock shown in the catalog is **remaining stock minus what is already in the current cart**. So if a product has 5 in stock and 3 are already in your cart, it shows 2 remaining.

#### Adding a Product to Cart

1. Click or tap any product row in the catalog.
2. A **Quantity Modal** appears.
3. The quantity field defaults to **1**.
4. Type the desired quantity (validated against available stock).
5. Press **Enter** or click **Add to Cart**.

If the item's SKU was scanned with a USB scanner, the product is added immediately with the quantity prompt.

#### Wholesale Mode

Toggle the **Wholesale Mode** switch (or press **F2**) to activate wholesale pricing:
- All products in the catalog display their **wholesale price** instead of retail.
- Cart totals are calculated using wholesale prices.
- Applies to all items — you cannot mix retail and wholesale in one transaction.

#### Results Only Mode

Toggle **Results Only** (or press **F3**) to hide the product catalog until you type or scan something. This is useful for high-speed scan-only checkout workflows.

The modal presents **three top-level payment categories**:

| Category | Key (F-Key) | Sub-methods |
|---|---|---|
| **Cash** | F1 | Cash only |
| **E-Wallet** | F2 | GCash (F3), Maya (F4) |

---

## 7. Discounts — Senior / PWD

The system includes a **Senior Citizen / PWD discount** feature, which is the only built-in discount type. There is no separate "Custom Discount" option.

### Senior / PWD Discount Button

Located at the top-right of the cart panel. It is labelled **Discount (F9)**.

- Pressing **F9** or clicking the **Discount** button toggles the Senior/PWD discount on or off.
- When **active**, the button turns yellow/amber to indicate it is applied.
- The cart footer displays: `Less: Senior/PWD (20%)` with the amount deducted.

### How the Discount is Calculated (Backend — Philippine Standard)

- A **20% discount** is applied to the entire subtotal.
- The backend (`PosController`) applies: `discountAmount = subtotal × 0.20`, then `total = subtotal − discountAmount`.
- This is recorded in the sale record as `discount_amount` and `is_senior = true`.
- No VAT-exclusive recalculation is shown in the UI — the 20% is a flat subtotal discount.

> [!NOTE]
> The Senior/PWD discount is a **single toggle for the entire order**. It cannot be applied to individual items only.

---

## 8. Hold & Recall Orders

Hold Orders (also called "Parked Orders") let you save the current cart and serve a different customer, then come back to the saved order later.

### Holding (Saving) an Order

1. With at least one item in the cart, click the **Save (F8)** button.
2. A dialog box appears asking for an optional **Reference Note** (e.g., "Table 5" or "Juan Santos").
3. Enter a note or leave blank (a random order number is assigned automatically).
4. Click **Save Order**.
5. The cart clears immediately, ready for a new order.

### Recalling a Held Order

2. The **Held Orders Modal** opens, listing all saved orders with their reference notes and totals.
3. Navigate with the **Arrow Up/Down** keys or click on an order.
4. Press **Enter** or click **Recall** to load the order into the cart.

> [!WARNING]

### Discarding a Held Order

In the Held Orders modal:

## 9. Closing a Shift (Z-Read)

At the end of your work period, you perform a **Z-Read** to close the shift. This records your cash count, calculates over/short, and emails a summary to all store admins.

### How to Close a Shift

1. Go to **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. Click the **Shift Summary** accordion section to expand it.
3. Review the live summary (Starting Cash, Cash Sales, Expected in Drawer, Digital Sales).
4. Click the **"Perform Z-Read & Close Shift"** button.
5. The **Close Shift Modal** appears with two steps.

### Close Shift Modal — Step by Step

#### Step 1: Drawer Cash Count (Required)

- Count the physical cash in your drawer.
- Enter the **actual cash count** in the large input field (in Philippine Peso ₱).
- This is the total cash physically present in the drawer.

#### Step 2: Total Expenses (Optional)

- Enter any cash that was **taken out of the drawer for store expenses** (e.g., petty cash payments).
- Leave at **₱0.00** if no cash was removed.

#### Click "Finalize & Close Shift"

The system calculates:

```
Expected in Drawer = Starting Cash + Cash Sales − Expenses
Difference = Actual Count − Expected in Drawer
```

If `Difference > 0` → **Drawer Overage** (more cash than expected)  
If `Difference < 0` → **Drawer Shortage** (less cash than expected)  
If `Difference ≈ 0` → **BALANCED**

### Z-Read Summary Screen

After closing, a **Z-Read Summary** is displayed showing:

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| Starting Cash | Cash at the start of this period (last close's actual count) |
| Cash Sales | Total cash received from all cash transactions |
| Less: Expenses | Cash removed from drawer for expenses (if entered) |
| Expected in Drawer | Starting Cash + Cash Sales − Expenses |
| Actual Count | The amount you physically counted |
| **Drawer Status** | BALANCED / Overage / Shortage |
| **Non-Cash Sales** | GCash, Maya, Credit Card, Debit/BancNet totals |
| **Total Gross Sales** | All payment methods combined |

### After Z-Read

Two action buttons appear:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| **Print Z-Read Report** | Sends the Z-Read to the connected thermal printer |
| **Logout** | Logs you out of the system cleanly |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **actual cash count you entered becomes the starting cash for the NEXT shift period**. Count your drawer carefully before entering — there is no way to edit this after closing.

> [!TIP]
> After closing, the system emails a shift summary to all store admins automatically.

## 22. Troubleshooting

### 🔴 Cannot process a sale — "No shift" message

**Reality:** The system uses a **continuous shift model**. You can sell any time without opening a shift. If you see a "no active shift" notice in the Settings page's Shift Summary, it simply means there are no sales recorded since the last Z-Read — this does not block you from selling.

---

### 🔴 Product shows "Sold Out" but should be in stock

**Cause 1:** The item's remaining stock minus the quantity already in your cart equals zero.
**Fix:** Check your current cart. If items are already there, that stock is reserved.

**Cause 2:** Actual inventory is zero.
**Fix (Admin):** Go to Inventory → find the product → Adjust Stock to add units.

---

### 🔴 Barcode scan doesn't find the product

**Cause:** The barcode on the physical item doesn't match the SKU stored in the system.
**Fix:** Check the product's SKU in Inventory matches the barcode exactly. Test by scanning into a text editor first.

---

### 🔴 Receipt is not printing after checkout

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| No printer shown | Go to Settings → Hardware → Pair USB (desktop) or Pair Bluetooth (mobile) |
| Printer paired but nothing prints | Check paper roll is loaded. Click **Test Print** to verify. |
| Wrong receipt width / text cut off | Go to Settings → Hardware → change Paper Width to match roll (58mm or 80mm) |
| Bluetooth printer disconnected | Go to Settings → Hardware → Disconnect, then re-Pair |

---

### 🔴 "Missing Reference" error when paying by E-Wallet or Card

**Cause:** A reference/approval number is required for all non-cash payments.
**Fix:** Enter the GCash/Maya transaction number or the card terminal receipt code before confirming.

---

### 🔴 Cannot void a transaction

**Cause:** Only Admins can void transactions. Cashiers do not have this permission.
**Fix:** Ask your store admin to process the void.

---

### 🔴 "Insufficient Cash" error during checkout

**Cause:** The cash amount entered is less than the total amount due.
**Fix:** Enter the correct amount the customer is paying. The system won't allow change to be negative.

---

### 🔴 Starting cash seems wrong on Z-Read

**How it works:** Starting cash is always the **actual cash count from the previous Z-Read**. If the previous cashier entered an incorrect amount at close, that carries forward.
**Fix:** Enter the correct actual count this time. Going forward, closing counts must be accurate.

---

### 🔴 Session expired / redirected to Login

**Cause:** Browser session has timed out due to inactivity.
**Fix:** Log in again. Your cart data is stored locally in the browser and should still be present after re-login.

---

### 🔴 Report data appears incomplete

**Cause:** Z-Reads were not performed, or the date range filter excludes the period.
**Fix:**
1. Verify the date range selected in Reports.
2. Confirm that cashiers performed Z-Reads covering the periods you're analyzing.
3. Use **Last 7 Days** preset first to confirm current data is loading.
